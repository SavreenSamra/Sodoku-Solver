# Sudoku-Solver
 A program that allows user to input their unsolved 9x9 Sudoku problems, which are then solved by an algorithm that was modelled based on the techniques and strategies I have developed through personal game-play. Currently waiting for 

## Project Objectives:
 - Sharpen my **logic based thinking** and **problem solving skills**. 
 - Supplement formal education. 
 - Practice **self-learning** with algorithms.

## Project Requirements:
 - represent the classic 9x9 Sudoku grid through some data representation
 - allow users to input their unsolved Sudoku puzzles via the console
 - allow users to edit specific Cells of the inputted, unsolved puzzle 
 - design and implement an algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzles
 - output the solved Sudoku puzzle to the console
 - output the initial, unsolved Sodoku puzzle to the console

## Key Features:
 - Program is written in C
 - Follows the typical C documentation for functions (function purpose, input and/or output parameters descriptors, and all return values is documented)
 - Uses both stack and heap memory to store variables and structures, optimizing memory when possible
 - Uses bit operations and techniques to store large amounts of data with relatively small amounts of total bytes
 - Uses arrays, structures, and string throughout

## NOTE:
Source files have not been added yet, currently waiting for confirmation about code copyright regarding a specific function from a Professor.
